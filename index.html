            <p><u>January 2022 to present - ARTBYTE.AGENCY (Russia, Kostroma)</u></p>
            <div class="article">
                  My responsibilities mainly include customizing <b>Bitrix24</b> portals in accordance with the wishes of clients,
                  as well as working with portal data and writing all kinds of reports, integrating client portals with external systems,
                  performing a number of administration functions.
                  Most of my projects and tasks were related to boxed versions of the portal, although I also happened to work with cloud
                  versions.
                  During my time at ARTBYTE.AGENCY, I completed more than 100 projects and tasks of various types and varying complexity.
                  I currently work with more than 10 portals for various clients. During the working day if necessary
                  I can switch to working with different tasks for different portals.
                  I have experience working with other people's code. On some portals I work with the code of two programmers who worked
                  before me in the absence of documentation..<br><br>

                Implementation of a custom service desk (the existing client was not satisfied). Executed using smart processes,
                tasks, lists. The lists have a three-level hierarchy of requests, sla, technical support users, divided into lines support.
                The first version of the request form was made by me in Vue.js. Deadlines for elements of requests and tasks in depending on
                sla, weekends and holidays, availability of employees of the nearest TP line (5 in total) on current and next days.
                If the corresponding line is unavailable, the next one will be used. To work with statistics requests, 5 custom reports with
                customer logic were implemented. The service desk is also synchronized with ZABIX. When certain ZABIX events occur, automatic
                calls are created using a custom webhook.
                To date, I have already implemented 3 similar projects
