 My responsibilities mainly include customizing **Bitrix24** portals in accordance with the wishes of clients,\

 I currently work with more than 10 portals for various clients. During the working day\if necessary
 I can switch to working with different tasks for different portals.\

  tasks, lists. The lists have a three-level hierarchy of requests, sla, technical support users, divided into lines support.\
